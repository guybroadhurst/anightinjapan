One of the five supreme stores is located in Omotesando in Harajuku, Tokyo, and this store is a smaller one in Tokyo comparing with the other one in Shibuya. If you have viewed my last article about goro's which is also in Omotesando, this supreme is exactly close to the goro's. You just have to turn left into the narrow street as you see goro's and a smart red logo saying, ["supreme"](https://www.supremenewyork.com/) will show up. It is on the second floor based on the black neighbourhood clothing store. I went upstairs and step into the store and a strong feeling of skateboarding culture impressed me a lot. There was a big screen always playing skateboarding videos and a huge arc light was in the right corner of the shop. The staff are normally friendly to you, while staffs in Shibuya got a worse attitude to travellers. 

Supreme items normally drop at 11 am local time every Saturday in Japan, so if you are interested in supreme and you are coincidentally in Japan, try your luck to queue for the drop one night before Saturday which is Friday. It is gonna be a time-consuming event, but it's one of the typical properties fashion events in Japan. There would be staff adjust the teams into different sections on the Friday night, and some people lucky who get a small number(there would be drawn before the line up) can get in the store preferentially. You can get some hyped items if you are less than 200, but it depends on what supreme are releasing that week, some of the most hyped items go pretty fast as they drop.  

Believe me, queuing can almost represent Japanese people attitude to life such that order is the most important rule to follow. However, if you go there not in the period of the season, there is actually not much good stuff selling in-store, for me, I just got a pack of 3 Hanes supreme tee for about 6000 yen, which is not a big deal but still decent. You can pay by credit card or cash, don't worry about what type of payment supreme can't do, they accept any payment.
